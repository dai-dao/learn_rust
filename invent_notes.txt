=> PLAN today 
	- implement a way to visualize trie, to see the compressed trie, that's the 
	best way to understand this 
		- then try the benchmark example, yea this is cool, performance, so FUN and FREE


	- 1 hour study Vectra? and cyber use cases 



	- after work, solve one programming problem woohoo

=> I wanna build something new, take the Meilisearch experimental search engine and re-build
and make it better woohoo

=> Also wanna schedule some time to learn about Rust internals
